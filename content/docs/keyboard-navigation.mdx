## Keyboard Navigation

Enable with `keyboardNavigation={true}`. This adds ARIA tree roles and full keyboard control, making the block tree accessible and navigable without a mouse.

### Key Bindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `ArrowUp` | Move focus to previous item |
| `ArrowDown` | Move focus to next item |
| `ArrowLeft` | Collapse container, or move to parent |
| `ArrowRight` | Expand container, or move to first child |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Toggle expand/collapse |
| `Home` | Focus first item |
| `End` | Focus last item |

### Usage

```tsx
<BlockTree
  blocks={blocks}
  renderers={renderers}
  containerTypes={['section']}
  onChange={setBlocks}
  keyboardNavigation={true}
/>
```

### Accessibility

When `keyboardNavigation` is enabled, the following ARIA attributes are applied automatically:

- Root element gets `role="tree"`
- Block items get `role="treeitem"`
- Containers get `aria-expanded` reflecting their open/closed state
- Focus management is handled automatically -- tabbing into the tree focuses the first item, and subsequent navigation uses arrow keys
- `aria-level` is set based on nesting depth

Keyboard navigation adds proper ARIA tree roles automatically. No extra configuration is needed -- just set `keyboardNavigation={true}` and the tree is fully accessible.
